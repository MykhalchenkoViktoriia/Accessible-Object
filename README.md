  - When you click somewhere - it gets the smallest Accessible object under mouse. 
  - It gets name, role and value for the accessible and adds it to the tree view under selected group (Control numbered globally, not within group).
  
When you click “Remove Group/Control” button:

  - It removes either selected group or control from the list.
